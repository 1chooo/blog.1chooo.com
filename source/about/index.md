#### 📢 **`2024 eCloudvalley Intern - Cloud Engineer 👨🏻‍💻`**

I'm **Hugo ChunHo Lin**, a 4th-year student at [National Central University (NCU) 🐿️](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), fueled by a ***sincere passion*** for the field of **Software Engineering 💻**.

*I do **Web Development and Cloud Development** with a focus on **creating APIs and handling backend tasks** using `FastAPI, Gin, and AWS`.* In general, I define new problems and find existing problems, transforming solutions into helpful documents or articles to assist everyone in the process, and eventually apply them to make social impacts.

In my spare time, I do *street photography 📷* and *consistently share my findings on GitHub with Global 🌏*.
