![Bachelor of Science in ATM, NCU Valedictorian Hugo](/images/about/hugo_valedictorian.jpg)


I'm **Hugo ChunHo Lin**, a 4th-year student at [National Central University (NCU) 🐿️](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), fueled by a ***sincere passion*** for the field of **Software Engineering 💻**.


Cloud computing, system programming, and contributing to open source are my main interests. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in these areas.
